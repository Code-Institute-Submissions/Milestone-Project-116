# Milestone Project 1: Build a personal portfolio website

> Sales Pitch:<br><br>A portfolio website that stands out because of its appeal and out of the box content approach.<br><br>
It will be a fun and pleasant way for recruiters or companies to find out more on Nico Pauwels, who will be the subject of this project. They will be able to obtain information on education, skills, workhistory and take a look at Nico's portfolio as a developer.<br><br>
Furthermore they will also gain some insight in miscellaneous activities Nico is involved in.<br><br>
Last but not least the project provides an easy way to get in touch with Nico.

# UX

## Strategy

> As mentioned in the sales pitch we want to develop an appealing portfolio website that leaves an impression with its users which will mostly be recruiters. The most important question here is definitely how do we stand out? What will leave an impression?<br><br>From the moment a user visits the website it is important that his curiousity is triggered and he or she is eager to find out more. A possible way to do this is to implement a hero image which will trigger the users interest and keep him or her on the website.<br><br>Another solution to trigger the users interest is to provide him or her with, next to the usual information you find on portfolio sites, out of the box content which will give him or her more insight on the personality behind the personalia data, skillset and workhistory.<br><br>Needless to say that it is in everyone's best intereset that users are able to make contact swiftly.

<br>

> User stories to take in account:
<br> - I want to find out more about Nico;<br>- I want to know more about Nico's education and current skillset;<br>- I want to know where Nico has worked in the past;<br>- I want to take a look at Nico's portfolio as a developer;<br>- It would be nice to find out more about Nico's leisure time activities;<br>- I have to contact this guy.

## Scope / Features

> Based on what we have determined in our strategy and taken into account in our user stories, the project should contain the following features:<br>
<br>- Appealing hero image;<br>- Intuitive navigation enabling users to find out more on education, skillset, work experience and projects worked on; which will be referred to as the <span style="color:blue">relevant information section</span>.<br>- In the same navigation being able to find out more on Nico's miscellaneous activities; which will be referred to as the <span style="color:red">less relevant information section</span>.<br>- Make it easy for users to get 
in touch; which will be referred to as the <span style="color:green">contact section</span>.<br><br>

<br>

>Future features:<br><br>A nice feature for the future might be to put all events regarding education, experience and portfolio on a timeline. Based on which category they belong to they will be labeled so that it is clear to the user whether this event has something to do with education, work experience or a new project that has been added to the portfolio.<br><br>Additionaly filters can be put on top of the timeline to enable the user to make a choice on which series of events he is interested in.

## Structure

> With the current scope, it's fair to say that we need a simple linear structure.<br><br>Three pages should suffice to cover the current scope:<br>1. <span style="color:blue">Relevant information section</span> containing: personal details, education, skills, work history and portfolio;<br>2. <span style="color:red">Less relevant information section</span> to provide overview of miscellaneous activities;<br>3. <span style="color:green">Contact section</span> containing a form to get in touch.

#### IXD

> Conventional navigation with highlighting of the users whereabouts and content hinting by partially revealing certain elements should suffice in terms of interactive design as the project structure is not that complex.

#### IA 

> A linear tree structure for this project seems like a good path to follow. The features we have defined in the scope can be presented in a straight forward, clear way. The figure below displays the tree structure for this project.<br><br><div align="center">![IA Tree Structure](/assets/images/readme/IA-tree-structure.png)</div>

## Skeleton

> Below the wireframes of the three determined sections:<br><br>1. <span style="color:blue">Relevant information section</span><br><br><div align="center">![Relevant Information Section](/assets/images/readme/relevant-information-section.png)</div><br>2. <span style="color:red">Less relevant information section</span><br><br><div align="center">![Less Relevant Information Section](/assets/images/readme/less-relevant-information-section.png)</div><br>3. <span style="color:green">Contact Section</span><br><br><div align="center">![Contact Section](/assets/images/readme/contact-section.png)</div>

## Surface

> Overall, we want this project to have a tight look but at the same time it needs to breath so choice of fonts, icons and colorschemes, but also the positioning will be important to reach this result.<br><br>In our strategy we have determined to use an eye catcher to spark the user's interest. For consistency and thus a good look and feel the choice of color scheme will be based on the eyecatcher we are going to implement.<br><br>Give an overview here of colorschemes; fonts; icons etc.
